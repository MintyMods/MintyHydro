To very briefly introduce myself, I am a software developer that loves everything about open source. Minty Hydro is one of my projects with a goal towards getting into electronics and embedded sofware just to see what is involved really. I like to produce projects in my own time using something different and  I came up with this totally crazy project idea to incorporate both a new softwre stack with some embedded hardware. What could go wrong...
